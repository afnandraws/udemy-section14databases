Section 14 Notes

You CANNOT connect to a database directly from a react app, this will leave the database vulnerable. 
Instead you must connect to a backend API which communicates with the database

API: Application Programming Interface

REST and GRAPHQL

the Fetch API is used to send and get information from a backend. It is built in to Javascript

Fetch sends a promise which we then need to handle

Fetch doesn't send a real error, Axios sends a real error

if you use response.status you can get the actual response status code
